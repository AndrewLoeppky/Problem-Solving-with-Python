# Functions and Modules

## Introduction

In computer programming, functions are a way to bundle multiple lines of code together to run as one block of code. Many functions accept input, called arguments, and produce output. Python has many built-in functions such as ```type()```, ```len()``` and ```pow()```. In this chapter you will learn how to create user-defined functions in Python.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

 * Call functions in Python
 
 * Import functions into Python scripts
 
 * Create user-defined functions 
    
 * Create functions with default arguments
 
 * Utilize functions with positional and keyword arguments
 
 * Write reusable code for other problem solvers to use
