# Loops

## Introduction

Repetition structures allow the same piece of code to run multiple times. Two repetion structures in Python are for loops and while loops. For loops run a set number of times. While loops run as long as a specific logical condition is true.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

 * use a while loop 
 
 * use a for loop
 
 * use the break statement
 
 * use the continue statement
 
 * construct flowcharts that describe programs with loops
