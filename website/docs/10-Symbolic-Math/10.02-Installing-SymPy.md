## Installing SymPy
To work with symbolic math in Python, the SymPy library needs to be installed. SymPy comes pre-installed with the Anaconda distribution of Python.
If you are not using the Anaconda distribution of Python, SymPy can be installed with the **Anaconda Prompt**. Use the command:

```text
> conda install sympy
```
Alternatively, you can install SymPy using the Python package manager **pip**. The command below installs SymPy into the current environment.

```text
$ pip install sympy
```
You can confirm your SymPy installation by opening up the Python REPL and typing the two commands below.
```text
>>> import sympy
>>> sympy.__version__
'1.4'
```
The ouput above shows SymPy version ```'1.4'``` is installed.
